# ICA on EEG

This repository is part of my Bachelor's thesis titled "Study on 3D Imaging Broadmann Area for Hand Gripping Activity Based on EEG Signal using ICA-eLORETA". In my thesis, ICA is used to acquire EEG signal that correspond to hand gripping activity. I used Matlab in applying ICA on the signal. More spesifically, I used EEGLAB library to load and preprocessed the signal. And also ICASSO library to acquire the components.
